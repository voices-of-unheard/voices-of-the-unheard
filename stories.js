  body: `<p>My name is Meera. I started working at my uncle’s tea stall when I was twelve. The kettle sings, the cups clink, people hurry — but sometimes, a child with tired eyes would sit and ask questions. There was no school nearby and no money. I would tear pages from old notebooks and draw letters with a chipped pencil on the tea crates. Over the years, more children came. They learned to read their names first, then numbers, then small stories about ants and rain.</p>
    <p>One day a boy read a whole sentence aloud without trembling. Someone in the market heard him and paid for a single notebook. That notebook multiplied into a dozen, then into a small library of thin books we kept on the top shelf. I still make tea. I still polish the cups. But when children come to learn, I close the stall for an hour and we read together.</p>
    <p>People call me strange for teaching instead of saving money. I call it the only saving I have ever made — a stack of small, bright eyes who know letters. When I see them read my handwriting years later and count the change before buying sweets, I know this was worth every morning spent standing over the kettle.</p>`
